# Medium Draft Conversion Instructions

## Overview
This document contains the key instructions and best practices for converting Hugo blog posts from raunaqness.com to Medium.com drafts.

## File Structure
- Create new file: `content/medium-draft.md`
- Use title format: "Medium Draft - [Post Name]"
- Set `draft: false` to make it visible in Hugo server

## Content Structure for Medium

### 1. Title & Subtitle
- **Title:** Use Medium-optimized format with em dash (—)
- **Subtitle:** One line description that hooks readers
- **Example:**
  ```
  # I Found the Best Tonkotsu Ramen in Bangalore — And It's Only 30 Bowls a Day
  
  ## How a small ramen shop in HSR Layout became my go-to comfort food spot after returning from Japan
  ```

### 2. Hero Image Placement
- **Position:** Right after subtitle, before any body text
- **Before:** The horizontal rule (---)
- **Purpose:** Grabs attention immediately, sets visual tone

### 3. Content Formatting
- **Use Medium-friendly headings** (## for sections)
- **Bold key points** with **double asterisks**
- **Keep paragraphs short** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Use bullet points** for lists and key information
- **Add horizontal rules** (---) for section breaks

### 4. Cross-Linking Strategy
- **Include links to raunaqness.com** naturally in content
- **Add bio link** at the end: "More food adventures at raunaqness.com/food"
- **Use Twitter link** for social engagement
- **Avoid "Originally posted on my blog"** - too obvious

### 5. Image Integration
- **Hero image:** Top of post, after subtitle
- **Supporting images:** Throughout content for engagement
- **Use Hugo picture shortcode** for proper rendering
- **Include alt text** for accessibility

## Medium-Specific Setup

### Tags (Maximum 5)
- **Essential:** Core topic (e.g., "Ramen")
- **Location:** City-specific (e.g., "BangaloreFood")
- **Cuisine:** Food category (e.g., "JapaneseFood")
- **Content Type:** "FoodBlog"
- **Broader Reach:** "IndiaFood"

### Canonical Link Setup
- **Enable:** "This story was originally published elsewhere"
- **Paste URL:** Original blog post URL from raunaqness.com
- **Purpose:** SEO protection, traffic direction to main site

### Bio Link
- **Add to Medium bio:** "More food adventures at raunaqness.com/food"
- **Strategy:** Drive traffic without violating Medium terms

## Content Optimization Tips

### 1. Hook Readers
- **Start with personal story** or discovery
- **Use specific details** (30 bowls a day, specific location)
- **Include price/value** information

### 2. Structure for Engagement
- **Short sections** (2-3 paragraphs max)
- **Actionable information** (location, tips, must-try items)
- **Personal experience** (visits, recommendations to friends)

### 3. SEO Elements
- **Location keywords** (Bangalore, HSR Layout)
- **Food-specific terms** (Tonkotsu, Ramen, Japanese)
- **Local business names** (Tokyo Suzuki Ramen)

## Copy-Paste Workflow

- **Add the 5 tags**

### 2. Medium Editor Setup
