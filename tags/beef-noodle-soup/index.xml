      <description>During my first week in Seoul, after a blur of Myeongdong street food and too many instant-ramen nights, I opened the Michelin Guide app to find something new. Niroumianguan popped up—nearby and budget-friendly—so I walked 10–15 minutes to check it out.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny spot (maybe 10–20 seats) with a memorable décor featuring clean white and vibrant rust colors. The place was fully booked when I arrived, so they asked me to come back the next morning.</description>

      <description>In July 2025, during my first trip to Kazakhstan, I found myself in the small, quiet town of Uralsk. The days were impossibly long—sunset around 11 PM—and dinner had turned into a late-night ritual. One chilly evening, with the temperature hovering around 18°C, we finally decided to step out for a proper meal.
I&amp;rsquo;d seen Lanzhou noodle shops before—first in Almaty, then again in Astana—but somehow never got around to trying them.</description>
