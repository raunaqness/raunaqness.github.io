Some weekday afternoons call for a little indulgence—and I found mine at **Malgudi Mylari Mane** in Koramangala. A small, curated menu. Open, airy space. A peek into the spotless kitchen. Everything about it told me I was in good hands.

The star of the show? Their **Chicken Keema Dosa**. Crisp on the outside, soft inside, and loaded with spiced, juicy chicken keema. It arrived at my table in minutes, yet tasted like something that had been perfected over years. **Easily one of the best I've had in Bangalore**.

I paired it with a tangy lemonade—simple, refreshing, and the perfect balance to the richness of the dosa. It's the kind of meal you slow down for, even on a busy day.  

If you're in Koramangala and craving a South Indian classic with a twist, this is where you should be headed.
