On my very first morning in Hong Kong, after arriving late the night before and surviving on just a 7-Eleven snack, I stepped out to explore the streets near my hostel. With no clear plan, I wandered until I spotted **Victory A Caf√©**‚Äîone of those classic local caf√©s I'd read about but never experienced.  

Inside, the space was cozy, with shared tables and that quick, no-nonsense service Hong Kong caf√©s are famous for. I ordered their **English breakfast**, which arrived in barely a couple of minutes: perfectly fried eggs, different kinds of sausages and slices of salami, a **very generous portion of fish fillet** (the absolute star of the meal), a small portion of salad, and a side of beans. I paired it with their **milk tea**, which was absolutely delicious. At around **HK$50**, it was hearty, comforting, and great value. I loved it so much I came back three more times that week.

A few days later, I found myself at **Shine Island Caf√©**, where I tried another unforgettable breakfast: thick, fluffy **Hong Kong-style French toast** with a side of hot **Ovaltine**. Sweet, rich, and perfectly indulgent, it was the kind of combination that instantly made it onto my "must-have again" list.

Both caf√©s became repeat stops during my week in Hong Kong‚Äînot just for the food, but for the warm, everyday charm that made each visit feel like part of my routine.
