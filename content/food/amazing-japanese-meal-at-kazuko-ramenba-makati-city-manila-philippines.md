It was my **second week in Manila**, near the end of my trip. A normal weeknight, but the streets of Makati were still alive with neon lights, music spilling out of bars, and the warm, humid air that wraps around you at night in the Philippines. Around **2 a.m.**, after a couple of hours of bar-hopping, I found myself wandering‚Äîhungry, curious, and not ready to call it a night‚Äîwhen I spotted [**Kazuko Ramenba**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dboSspfmom3n4vbC6) glowing invitingly on the corner.  

The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted warmly by the chefs, and the cozy, izakaya-style counter seating made me feel instantly at home. Since I was the only customer at that hour, I got to watch them cook right in front of me, chat about my travels, and soak in the atmosphere.  

I ordered their **tonkotsu ramen**, paired with **chicken karaage** and **shrimp tempura**‚Äîa chef's recommendation I'm very glad I took. The ramen was spot-on: rich, silky broth, perfectly chewy noodles, and tender slices of meat. The karaage was crisp on the outside, juicy inside, and the tempura was light yet satisfying. And the best part? All of it for around **‚Ç±700** (roughly ‚Çπ1,050)‚Äî**incredible value** for such quality.

I ended up coming back here a couple more times during my trip‚Äîright up until my last night in the Philippines before flying to Hong Kong. There's something about finding a **24-hour ramen joint** that serves food this good‚Äîit becomes more than a meal; it becomes a memory.  

If you ever find yourself wandering the streets of Makati late at night, skip the fast food and head here. Trust me‚Äîyou'll want to come back again and again.
