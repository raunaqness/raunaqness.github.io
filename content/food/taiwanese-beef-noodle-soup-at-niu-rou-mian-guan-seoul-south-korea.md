During my first week in Seoul, after a blur of Myeongdong street food and too many instant-ramen nights, I opened the **Michelin Guide** app to find something new. **Niu Rou Mian Guan** popped up—nearby and budget-friendly—so I walked 10–15 minutes to check it out.

It's a tiny spot (maybe 10–20 seats) and was **fully booked** when I arrived. They asked me to come back the next morning. Slightly heartbroken, very hungry—but also excited. I showed up for breakfast, snagged a table, and that's when the magic started.

They serve basically **two dishes** and a choice of rice or noodles. I went straight for the **signature beef noodle soup**—about **₩10,000**, which is a steal for food at this level. The bowl landed in front of me within **1–2 minutes** (**[insert photo here]**).

First sip of broth—rich, comforting, deeply beefy. Springy noodles, **tender beef**, and a perfectly marinated egg. I finished the bowl in minutes. It instantly became one of those meals you **know you'll come back for**.

I ended up returning **four more times**, each visit with a different friend from my hostel. Every single one loved it and thanked me for bringing them. It quickly turned into my **go-to comfort meal** in Seoul.

If you're visiting Seoul for the first time, add this to your list. It's **Michelin-level food on a budget**. Pro tip: taste the broth first, then add a little of their house chili oil if you want extra heat.
