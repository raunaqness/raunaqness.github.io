During my first week in Seoul, after a blur of Myeongdong street food and too many instant-ramen nights, I opened the **Michelin Guide** app to find something new. **[Niroumianguan](https://guide.michelin.com/en/seoul-capital-area/kr-seoul/restaurant/niroumianguan)** popped up—nearby and budget-friendly—so I walked 10–15 minutes to check it out.

It's a tiny spot (maybe 10–20 seats) with a memorable décor featuring clean white and vibrant rust colors. The place was **fully booked** when I arrived, so they asked me to come back the next morning. Slightly heartbroken, very hungry—but also excited. I showed up for breakfast, snagged a table, and that's when the magic started.

They serve basically **two dishes** and a choice of rice or noodles. I went straight for the **signature Chinese beef noodle soup**—about **₩10,000**, which is a steal for **Michelin Bib Gourmand** food at this level. The bowl landed in front of me within **1–2 minutes**.

First sip of broth—**mildly sweet**, clean yet rich, deeply comforting. The chef learned the recipe from a noodle joint in China's Shandong Province, so it's slightly different from the classic Taiwanese style. Springy noodles, **tender beef**, and plenty of cilantro. I finished the bowl in minutes. It instantly became one of those meals you **know you'll come back for**.

I ended up returning **four more times**, each visit with a different friend from my hostel. Every single one loved it and thanked me for bringing them. It quickly turned into my **go-to comfort meal** in Seoul.

If you're visiting Seoul for the first time, add this to your list. It's **Michelin Bib Gourmand** food on a budget. Pro tip: taste the broth first, then add a dab of their chili sauce to give your dish deeper flavor.
