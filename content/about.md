When I'm not working, I like to hit the gym / play outdoor sports, [travel](/travel) or [read](/books).

I like to dabble with a lot of technologies, and have extensive experience working with Webapps, DevOps/Cloud, Mobile apps, and Machine Learning. Having said that, I'm always trying to challenge myself by learning new things, but at its core, I love solving problems.
