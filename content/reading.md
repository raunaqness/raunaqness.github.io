| {{< review title="Amazon Sumerian by Tutorials" author="Gur Raunaq Singh (me) & Brian Moakley" >}}I co-authored this book in 2020 in partnership with the Raywenderlich writing team. It’s a hands-on, practical guide to building AR/VR experiences with Amazon Sumerian, focused on creating interactive 3D scenes and deploying them on the web—without requiring deep expertise in graphics or game engines. If you want a pragmatic, builder-first introduction to web-based 3D and AR/VR, this book was written exactly for that.{{< /review >}} | Gur Raunaq Singh (me) & Brian Moakley | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="Big Book of Tell Me Why" author="Arkady Leokum" >}}My uncle (my dad’s elder brother) gave this to me when I was around four or five years old, while I was staying at his place for a few days. He was a scholar, a brilliant scientist, and a lifelong teacher. He had owned his copy of this book for over a decade before passing it on to me. I remember learning to type on my computer by reading its short chapters and typing them out in MS Word, slowly absorbing the lessons along the way.<br><br>> *“What is pain? Do you ever wish you couldn’t feel pain in your body? Well, you should consider yourself lucky that you can feel pain! Pain is your protector.”*<br><br>I can still vividly remember the day I read that. It changed me. I genuinely believe this book made me curious about the world, sparked my interest in science, and taught me to wonder—and in many ways, changed the trajectory of my life for the better. This is a book that deserves to be gifted to every child. If you’re reading this, buy one for your kid.{{< /review >}} | Arkady Leokum | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="12 Rules for Life" author="Jordan B. Peterson" >}}This was an incredibly challenging book for me to read—mostly because it often feels more like a dense research paper than a conventional book. It took me days just to get through the first chapter. But it’s also one of those rare books whose ideas stay with you long after you’ve finished it. Blending psychology, philosophy, and practical wisdom, it offers principles for responsibility, discipline, and meaning in a chaotic world. Some parts genuinely reshaped the way I see things. This isn’t a book you simply read and move on from—it has the potential to change you, if you let it.{{< /review >}} | Jordan B. Peterson | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="Shoe Dog" author="Phil Knight" >}}The memoir of Nike’s founder, chronicling the scrappy and uncertain early days of building the company. It’s a candid, honest story about entrepreneurship, risk-taking, and perseverance—and an extremely easy read. I went through it in one or two sittings. If you want a raw, human look at what building a global company actually feels like, this is a great pick.{{< /review >}} | Phil Knight | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="The Sikhs" author="Khushwant Singh" >}}A comprehensive yet accessible history of Sikhism and the Sikh people, covering its religious origins, cultural evolution, and role in Indian and world history. I was never particularly interested in religion growing up, but with age—and a better understanding of history and society—I’ve come to appreciate its importance, especially in a country like India. I stumbled upon this book while wandering around Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai, at what felt like exactly the right time in my life. It gave me valuable historical context and made me a little more self-aware, helping me understand my roots and lineage better.{{< /review >}} | Khushwant Singh | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="Total Recall" author="Arnold Schwarzenegger" >}}An autobiography tracing Arnold’s journey from a small Austrian village to global fame in bodybuilding, Hollywood, and politics. The stories are fascinating and entertaining, but the real takeaway is perseverance. This book is a powerful reminder that grit and consistency can take you almost anywhere. The sheer amount Arnold achieved in a single lifetime—more than most people do in several—is inspiring. Honestly, it’s one of the best self-help books disguised as an autobiography.{{< /review >}} | Arnold Schwarzenegger | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" author="Eric Jorgenson" >}}A curated collection of Naval Ravikant’s thoughts on wealth, happiness, leverage, and decision-making, distilled from tweets, interviews, and essays. Most ideas will probably pass you by without much impact—but if you encounter the right one at the right moment in your life, it can genuinely shift your mindset. This isn’t for everyone: if you’re already part of the startup or hustle world and know who Naval is, it’s a great read—otherwise, you can safely skip it.{{< /review >}} | Eric Jorgenson | ★★★★☆ |
| {{< review title="Designing Distributed Systems" author="Brendan Burns" >}}A practical guide to designing, building, and operating distributed systems using cloud-native patterns. It explains common architectural approaches with real-world use cases and trade-offs. This is an especially good book if you’re in the early stages of your software engineering career—regardless of whether you work in frontend, backend, or mobile. It gives you proven mental models to break down complex systems, so you don’t have to reinvent solutions that much smarter people have already figured out.{{< /review >}} | Brendan Burns | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="Principles" author="Ray Dalio" >}}In 1975, Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Over the next four decades, it grew into one of the most influential private companies in the United States. Along the way, he developed a set of principles that shaped Bridgewater’s unique culture—what he calls an “idea meritocracy” built on radical transparency. This book is about those principles more than it is about Dalio himself. It’s an excellent read for building mental models and understanding how the world works—especially if you’re interested in economics, politics, investing, and how cycles of good times and bad times repeat themselves.{{< /review >}} | Ray Dalio | ★★★★★ |
| {{< review title="100 Inventions That Changed the World" author="DK" >}}I stumbled upon this book in the common room of the hotel I was staying at the first time I set foot in Bangalore.
